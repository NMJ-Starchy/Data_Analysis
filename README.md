## Ramen Ratings

As a hungry college student, I have often wondered how I can get the best bang for my buck. For most who think the same way I do in college, their go to option is Ramen, a cheap, easily made food that in no way breaks the bank. 

This leads me to a couple questions that could help some students decide what kind of ramen to get. One: What kind of ramen style is the best? Two: What country makes the best ramen?

### Analysis

From the graphics, we can see that almost unsurprisingly most asian countries make the most ramen products, as well as some of the best. Some of the more interesting things can be seen that some ramen products from Mexico and other south american continents also produce some good quality ramen.
