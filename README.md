## Ramen Ratings

As a hungry college student, I have often wondered how I can get the best bang for my buck. For most who think the same way I do in college, their go to option is Ramen, a cheap, easily made food that in no way breaks the bank. 

This leads me to a couple questions that could help some students decide what kind of ramen to get. One: What kind of ramen style is the best? Two: What country makes the best ramen?
